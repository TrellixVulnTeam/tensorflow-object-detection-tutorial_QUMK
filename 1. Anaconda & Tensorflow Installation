<Introdution>
In the session, we would install anaconda and tensorflow(CPU & GPU).

<Part One>      Anaconda Installation
Download and install Anaconda, here is the official download page.  https://www.anaconda.com/
(Recommand) Anaconda works almost perfect if it is installed in 'C:\', therefore I strongly recommend installing it on the C drive derectly.When you finish it, you 
could find 'Anaconda Navigator' in the 'Start Menu'. For convenience, a desktop shortcut could be created for it.
Run 'Anaconda Navigator' to confirm if it work correctly.

<Part Two>      Tensorflow CPU Version Installation and verification
For the newer, after you open 'Anaconda Navigator', you could find 'Environment' on the left, click it and you could find 'Create' button. In the window, fill in the
following information, 'Name: tensorflow', 'Python: 3.9.12'.
In addition, you could run 'Anaconda Prompt' and type the following command:
$ conda create -n tensorflow pip python=3.9   ......(1)
After that, type the following command:
$ activate tensorflow
$ pip install tensorflow==2.9.1
This would last from a few minutes to half an hour, depending on your computer configuration and network conditions. 
After that, now we should verify the installation, type the following command:
$ python
$ import tensorflow as tf
$ print(tf.__version__)
Notice: This tutorial use tensorflow-gpu-2.9.1
If you get the report '2.9.1', it means that you have installed tensorflow-cpu-2.9.1 successfully!
Before starting the steps below (<Part Three>), make sure your computer supports tensorflow GPU version, type the following command after the last print:
$ tf.test.is_gpu_available()
if the answer is 'True', you could follow <Part Three>; or 'False' means that your computer does not fit the tensorflow GPU version, skip from <Part Three> 
to <Part Five>.

<Part Three>    Tensorflow GPU Version Installation
To reduce possible errors during the installation process, it is strongly recommended to install both versions at the same time.
If you have built the 'tensorflow' environment, skip (1). Type the following command:
$ activate tensorflow
$ pip install tensorflow-gpu==2.9.1
After finish that, tensorflow GPU version do not work until <Part Four> done.

<Part Four>     NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit
Tensorflow GPU version ask for the suport by NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit, including 'GEFORCE EXPERIENCE', 'CUDA' and 'CUDNN'.
A. 'GEFORCE EXPERIENCE'
https://www.nvidia.cn/geforce/drivers/
B. 'CUDA':
https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads
C. 'CUDNN':
https://developer.nvidia.com/rdp/cudnn-download
D. Download A, B and C, install them one by one. I recommand install 'CUDA' on the C drive. On my computer, 'CUDA' path is:
>> C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v11.2
Unzip the 'CUDNN' zip and rename the folder as 'cudnn', copy it and put at the '\CUDA\v11.2\'. On my computer, 'CUDNN' path is:
>> C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v11.2\cudnn
E. Download zlib
Click the below url, http://www.winimage.com/zLibDll/zlib123dllx64.zip
After download, you should unzip it and put it into the System32. On my computer, my path is:
>> C:\Windows\System32\zlib123dllx64
F. Configuration
For now, CUDA, CUDNN and zlib have been installed, next is to set the system environment variebles.
Cd 'Environment Variebles', choose the 'Path' from 'System Variebles', open the 'Path' and add the below paths:
>> C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v11.2\bin
>> C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v11.2\libnvvp
>> C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v11.2\include
>> C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v11.2\extras\CUPTI\lib64
>> C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v11.2\cudnn\bin
>> C:\Windows\System32\zlib123dllx64\dll_x64\zlibwapi.dll
Above paths are set under the default situation, you may make some changes according to your installation. For now, the configuration of 
'NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit'   has been done.
If you meet some errors in this part, you can follow the NVIDIA offical guide in this url:
https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/cudnn/install-guide/index.html#installcuda-windows

<Part Five>     Tensorflow GPU Version Verification
Run 'Anaconda Prompt', then type the following command:
$ activate tensorflow
$ python
$ import tensorflow as tf
$ tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')
If the answer be like below, congratulations! Tensorflow GPU version has been installed on your computer!
>> [PhysicalDevice(name='/physical_device:GPU:0', device_type='GPU')]

<Conclusion>
This session is important, <Part Four> needs to be repeatedly confirmed if you want to use tensorflow-gpu!
That's all, next to '2. TensorFlow Object Detection API Installation'.
