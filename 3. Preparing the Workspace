This Section aims to prepare the Wokrkspace for Making Dataset, Training, Verifying, Saving and Deploying the Model.

The workspace is essentially composed of multiple folders with different functions. Based on sglvladi's work, I make some expansions to save the important scripts and process text. Therefore, this section will be introduced according to the function of each file, rather than the installation steps of a certain software.
