Thanks sglvladi, his work has help lots of people like me, who wants to use tensorflow object detection API to train and test own datasets more easily, and then work on the tiny ccomputer like RaspberryPi 4B+.

This is the url of the origin tutorial, shown as following. It may work on May 8, 2021.

However, as the time passing by, something has changed. I follow the origin tutorial to configure the environment, errors occurs many times because . For helping every person to use tensorflow object detection API, the essay would update the official tutorial by myself, including downloading, installation and configuration. If you follow this tutorial and find some errors, please put the errors in detail in 'Issues', I believe that we could solve them together.

Notice: The tutorial works on Windows 11, other OS like Linux and MacOS are not verified.

That's all, next to '1. Anaconda & Tensorflow Installation'.
