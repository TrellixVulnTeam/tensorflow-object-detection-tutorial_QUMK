5. Generate Model
You could follow these files to learn about how to build the environment and using tensorflow object detection API.

Second, "models" comes from Tensorflow Official Github, the url is: https://github.com/tensorflow/models
Why did I download and save a past version? Because each part of using TF2-Obj-Dec-API needs the suppot of suitable version.

Third, "protoc-3.19.4-win64" comes from https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases
It is one of the most important part to build the environment.

Forth, "workspace" is the main folder contains "training_demo". "training_demo" makes your training job become easier.

Thanks for your reading, please give me a STAR!
